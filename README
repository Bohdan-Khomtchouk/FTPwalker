FTPflow is a Python package for optimally traversing extremely large FTP directory trees.

Here is an example of FTPflow traversing the Uniprot_ bioinformatics database:

.. code-block:: python

	from FTPflow.runwalker import FTPflow

	walker = FTPflow("Uniprot", "ftp.uniprot.org")
	walker.check_state()



This will create a dictionary formatted as a JSON file in the userâ€™s home directory containing all the full paths as keys and the respective filenames as values. FTPflow is designed with speed in mind by utilizing state-of-the-art high performance parallelism and concurrency algorithms to traverse FTP directory trees. The resultant hash table (i.e., dictionary) supports fast lookup for any file in any biological database.


Installation:

For running the FTPflow you need to have python3.x+ installed. Then you can use `pip` or `pip3` for installation. 

.. code-block:: python
    
    # Install
	sudo pip3 install FTPflow

	# Upgrade
	sudo pip3 install FTPflow --upgrade
