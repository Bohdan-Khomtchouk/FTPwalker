FTPwalker is a Python package for optimally traversing extremely large FTP directory trees.

Here is an example of FTPwalker traversing the miRBase_ bioinformatics database:

.. code-block:: python

	from FTPwalker.runwalker import ftpwalker

	walker = ftpwalker("Uniprot", "ftp.uniprot.org")
	walker.check_state()



This will create a dictionary formatted as a JSON file in the userâ€™s home directory containing all the full paths as keys and the respective filenames as values. FTPwalker is designed with speed in mind by utilizing state-of-the-art high performance parallelism and concurrency algorithms to traverse FTP directory trees. The resultant hash table (i.e., dictionary) supports fast lookup for any file in any biological database.
