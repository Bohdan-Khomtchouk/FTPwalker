This module is used to fork the current process into a daemon.
Almost none of this is necessary (or advisable) if your daemon
is being started by inetd. In that case, stdin, stdout and stderr are
all set up for you to refer to the network connection, and the `fork()`s
and session manipulation should not be done (to avoid confusing inetd).
Only the `chdir()` and `umask()` steps remain as useful.
